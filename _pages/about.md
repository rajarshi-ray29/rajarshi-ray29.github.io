Background
======
I was born in Virginia, USA, and moved to India at an early age. I had the privilege of growing up in the city of Bangalore, the country’s tech hub. Being surrounded by such a vibrant technology-driven environment sparked my early interest in **Computer Science** and inspired me to pursue a future in the field. My parents have been my greatest influences. My father, a PhD, instilled in me a **passion for research** and motivates me to follow a similar path, while my mother, a doctor, nurtured my curiosity in **healthcare technology** and taught me the importance of compassion in everything I do. Alongside these influences, an **early education in music** helped me develop **balance, discipline, and creativity**, which continue to shape the way I approach my work and aspirations.

For my undergraduate studies, I attended **BITS Pilani**, one of India’s most prestigious universities. There, I not only deepened my technical foundation but also explored leadership and creativity.  

- 🎤 Led and organized multiple **Open Mic nights** through the Cultural Club.
- 🎭 Directed and acted in a **musical play**, leading 50+ juniors to perform at our annual cultural fest.
- 👨‍💻 Participated in numerous **hackathons**, and was active in the **Developers Society** and **Entrepreneurship Club**.

These experiences shaped my ability to **collaborate, lead, and innovate** — qualities I now bring into both research and professional settings.  

I’m also deeply passionate about building things outside the classroom. One of my personal projects was creating an **AI assistant robot** with a **Raspberry Pi**, capable of **face tracking, interaction, and Q&A** powered by LLMs.

All of these experiences — from music to hackathons, from research to robotics — continue to inspire me to bridge **technology, creativity, and human connection** in my academic and professional journey.
